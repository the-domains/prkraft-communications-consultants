Born from the ashes of the 1998 global economic meltdown, we are a boutique public relations consultancy that thrives on delivering top-notch work to a select group of fans (others call them clients). **Welcome to PRKraft!**

We are as boutique as it can be. A husband-and-wife team, toiling from our little study room, but one with a view to die for. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2f1f3f4f-4c4a-4d84-9ee4-03f0f4fa9bdc.jpg)

**Kong Wai Keong **and **Villie For** bring a valuable combination of communications and marketing expertise and experience to the table. A Mass Communications graduate, Kong began his career with Leo Burnett before moving to Peter Beaumont & Friends and subsequently, Burson-Marsteller. Villie was previously Group Product Manager with pharmaceutical giant Smithkline Beecham (now Glaxo Smithkline). A law graduate from University of Essex in the United Kingdom, her vast marketing experience and perspective from the client side add a new dimension to any communications plan.

What sets us apart from the rest must be our **personalised service** and the ability to **ask the right questions **so that we can **help you make the right headlines.**

We started with one single client, a homegrown IT company called DagangNet, to whom we are forever grateful for trusting us with their business. However, since then, we have been blessed with an enviable fan club, comprising some of the biggest names across industries. 

**Shell Lubricants Malaysia **have retained our services for the past five years. We manage the media relations for their three lubricant brands -- **Shell Helix** for cars, **Shell Advance** for motorcycles and **Shell Rimula** for trucks.

This year, we are delighted to welcome **Coleman Malaysia **on board as a retainer client. The trusted outdoor recreation expert since 1901, this iconic American lifestyle brand nicely complements some of the automotive brands that we work with.

**Jaguar Land Rover Malaysia **engages us to manage the external communications for their Land Rover and Jaguar marques on an ad hoc basis. We have been working with Land Rover since 2004 and welcomed Jaguar on board in 2014\. What a privilege!

Leading automotive group **MBM Resources Berhad** has been engaging us to manage their post-Annual General Meeting press conferences since 2011\.

Along the way, we have also had the opportunity to work with some of their business units, including FA Trucks, the distributor of IVECO commercial vehicles in Malaysia.

We are very proud of our fan club alumni. We have fond memories and great satisfaction of working with **Hino Manufacturing Malaysia;** from the groundbreaking ceremony in July 2013 to the line-off ceremony of its first truck in April 2014 and lastly, the official opening of its manufacturing plant in Sendayan in August 2014\.

We are also thankful to have had the opportunity to help build brands from scratch into some of the most recognisable ones today.  Two that come to mind are the iconic love-em-or-hate-em footwear brand **Crocs **and home-grown Shanghainese cuisine specialist **Dragon-i **and its Hong Kong cuisine sister brand, **Canton-i. **
